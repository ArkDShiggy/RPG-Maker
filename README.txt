RPG MAKER is a tool to create RPGs in the 16-bit Dragon Quest style.
RPG MAKER is made of two parts, a program with a user interface that will generate a database of objects. And the game code that uses said database to run the game.
It is not required to modify the game code to make a game but this the part I worked on.

I programmed a lot of RPG MAKER stuff. Most of the time I was doing some very small script (less than a few hours of work) that change the UI, the UX or the mechanics slightly.
But I did work on some bigger scale stuff that I'm trying to present here.

There are two differents folders, for two differents versions of RPG MAKER.
RPG MAKER MV the latest version written in Javascript.
RPG MAKER VX ACE the penultimate version written in Ruby.

I started with VX ACE, and thus it is the version I am the most familiar with.
In VX ACE, the lower levels of the game code are not visible, they are at least partly documented tho and because Ruby is an interpreted language , you can still modify the code (although it is rarely required). The rest of the code is very well organised and commented which made it easy to learn.
In MV, all the game code is open but the code is not as well organised and commented. Luckily despite being written in another language, the architecture is more than 90% the same which made it easy to go from VX ACE to MV.
