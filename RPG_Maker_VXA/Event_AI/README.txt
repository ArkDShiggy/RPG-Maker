RPG Maker has a built-in graphical programming language to handle events in the game.
The NPC that appear in the game are events and their behavior is defined with this programming language.
This script was made to give those NPC enemies more interesting and more autonomous behavior.

With this AI script, the NPC move through a circuit in a semi-random manner. If the encounter other NPC or the player, they either chase those or try to run away. It is also possible to define areas where the NPCs will never go. The goal was to simulate animal behavior that would look for food and run away from predators.
